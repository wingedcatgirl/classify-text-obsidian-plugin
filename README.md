# Obsidian Classify Text

Apply custom CSS classes to selected text in your Obsidian Notes. Derived from [juanjoarranz's extension that does the same thing with styles](https://github.com/juanjoarranz/style-text-obsidian-plugin).

Works basically the same as the source plugin, but applies classes (that you gotta [predefine in your CSS snippets](https://help.obsidian.md/snippets)) instead of inline styles. In case you're writing for somewhere like AO3 that lets you define your own classes but not use inline styles. You know how it is.

# To install
Extract the zip or clone the repo into your plugins folder. I only really made this for my own use, tbh, so I won't be putting it in the official Obsidian listing or whatever unless there's, like, actual demand for it.

I think technically you only need `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json`, but the other files shouldn't hurt. Probably. Look, I don't actually know TypeScript.
